#               NLOPT_HOME is the directory where a working installation of 
#               NLopt is located (within subdirectories NLOPT_VERSION/R_ARCH)
# 18 November 2011: Removed NLOPT_VERSION macro and adopted some other changes
#                   proposed by Brian Ripley to make nloptr work with his new toolchain.
#                   NLopt should now be located in NLOPT_HOME/R_ARCH (i.e. without
#                   version number)
