12 August 2011, version 0.8.4:

	* added new options:
		- data/nloptr.default.options.R: new file with a description of all options, mostly taken from the NLopt website (for internal use).
		- R/nloptr.print.options.R: function to show the description for a specific (set of) option(s). 
		  E.g. nloptr.print.options( option="maxeval" )
		  nloptr.print.options() shows a description of all options if called without arguments.
		- added option to print a description of all options and their values ('print_options_doc' = TRUE/FALSE).
		- added option population to set the population of stochastic/global solvers ('population' = 1000).
		- added option ranseed which sets the random seed for stochastic solvers ('ranseed' = 3141). A value of 0 uses a random seed generated by system time.
		- option check_derivatives is no longer listed as a termination condition.
		- documented the option to set the tolerance of (in)equality constraints (tol_constraints_eq, tol_constraints_ineq).
		
	* tests/banana_global.R: new test file that uses the algorithms (CRS, ISRES, MLSL) and options ranseed and population.
	
	* src/nloptr.c: capture error codes from setting options.

	* R/nloptr.print.R: output gives 'optimal value of controls' when status = -4 (some error code), this is changed to 'current value of controls'.
